# 2. Setting Executor options

In this example we:

- Create `helper.py` and move some stuff there (to keep `app.py` light)
- Run `SimpleIndexer` in Docker too
- Pass parameters to our Executors to override their default behavior ([docs reference](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/add-exec-to-flow/#override-executor-config))
